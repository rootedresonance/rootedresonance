  <div class="wrap col-c prose rv">
    <p>I have spent my life living out the patterns of adapting, people pleasing, and mastering the
    art of self abandonment. Not because I wanted to, but because that is what I thought I needed to
    do to survive.</p>
    <p>My own healing journey led me to a different question. Not "How do I become who I am supposed
    to be?" but "Who am I when I am no longer performing for belonging?" That question became the
    foundation for Rooted Resonance.</p>

    <h2>What actually changed things</h2>
    <p>I spent years intellectualizing my problems. I knew every trauma, every trigger, I could even
    tell you why I did the things I did, but none of that changed anything. I kept repeating the
    patterns until I began focusing less on learning, or talking about my problems, and more on
    feeling and experiencing.</p>
    <blockquote>Real change happened when I learned to listen to my body, understand my nervous
    system, and build a kinder more honest relationship with myself.</blockquote>

    <h2>Who I work with</h2>
    <p>I find myself working with people who have spent years adapting to keep relationships, avoid
    conflict, earn love, meet expectations, or all of the above. Most arrive feeling lost, worried
    about the future and unsure of their place in it. They are exhausted, burnt out from trying to
    fit in, and they don't know how to change it.</p>
    <p>I am a queer, ethically non monogamous, kink and sex positive Licensed Professional Counselor
    in the states of Ohio, Arizona, and Colorado, with a passion for working with people who feel
    like they don't know who they are and are in search of a deeper understanding of themselves.
    Over the past 6 years I have worked in private practice serving LGBTQIA+, neurodivergent, and
    kinky communities, assisting people in and out of relationships of all kinds to find who they
    are in the midst of feeling pressured to be like everyone else.</p>

    <h2>What I believe</h2>
    <p>I believe this is not about fixing yourself. It is about remembering who you have always been.</p>
    <p>At Rooted Resonance, I help people come home to themselves through therapy, sound healing,
    nervous system education, embodiment practices, and authentic community. My goal isn't to tell
    you who to be. It's to help you discover who you are beneath the roles, the expectations, and
    the survival strategies you have learned along the way.</p>
