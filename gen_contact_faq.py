 qa("I don't know what I need. Where do I start?",
    "<p>That is a completely normal place to begin, and it is the reason the framework exists. Have a "
    "look at the five stages and see which one sounds like where you are. If none of them do, or several "
    "do, reach out and say that. Sorting it out together is part of the work.</p>"),
 qa("What is the difference between the therapy and the other offerings?",
    "<p>Somatic and relational therapy are psychotherapy. I provide those as a Licensed Professional "
    "Counselor, and they are available to residents of Ohio, Arizona and Colorado.</p>"
    "<p>Sound healing, breathwork and workshops are wellness and educational services. They are not "
    "psychotherapy, they are not a substitute for it, and they are open to anyone regardless of where "
    "you live.</p>"),
 qa("Can we work together if I do not live in Ohio, Arizona or Colorado?",
    "<p>Yes, for sound healing, breathwork and workshops. Not for therapy. Counseling licenses are "
    "state by state, so therapy is limited to the states where I am licensed.</p>"),
 qa("What happens after I reach out?",
    "<p>I reply, usually within two business days. If it looks like a fit we set up a short "
    "conversation at no cost, and if it does not, I will say so and try to point you somewhere useful.</p>"),

    "<li><strong>Workshops</strong> pricing varies by format and length</li></ul>"),
 qa("Do you take insurance?",
    "<p>Yes, most major insurances are accepted for therapy. If you would like the full list of plans "
    "I am in network with, just ask and I will send it.</p>"
    "<p>Sound healing, breathwork and workshops are wellness services and are not billable to "

    "will cost before you start. <a class='link' href='/good-faith-estimate'>Full details are "
    "here</a>, and I will provide one in writing on request.</p>"),
 qa("What is your cancellation policy?",
    "<p>Please give at least 24 hours notice if you need to cancel or reschedule. Late cancellations "
    "and missed appointments may be charged the full session rate. Life happens, and if something "
    "genuinely unavoidable comes up, tell me.</p>"),

 qa("I have done therapy before and it did not change anything.",
    "<p>You are describing the most common reason people find me. Understanding your patterns is a "
    "cognitive act, and it happens in a different part of you than the part running the pattern. "
    "Somatic work goes after the reflex where it lives rather than where it gets explained.</p>"),
 qa("Do I have to talk about my trauma?",
    "<p>No. You set the pace, and nothing gets opened before there is enough support to hold it. "
    "Sound healing in particular is built for the days when talking is not the way in.</p>"),
 qa("Is sound healing woo?",
    "<p>It is a wellness practice, and I describe it as exactly that rather than as treatment. What it "
    "reliably does is slow the nervous system down and bring attention back into the body without "
    "requiring you to narrate anything. Plenty of people arrive skeptical. That is fine.</p>"),
 qa("How long does this take?",

    "gradual for a long time and then, fairly suddenly, obvious.</p>"),

("Working with me", [
 qa("Are you queer, poly and kink affirming?",
    "<p>Yes, and not in a passive way. I am a queer, ethically non monogamous, kink and sex positive "
    "therapist, and I have spent six years working with LGBTQIA+, neurodivergent and kinky communities. "
    "You will not need to explain your relationship structure or your identity from scratch.</p>"),
 qa("Do you work with people in relationships of any configuration?",
    "<p>Yes. Partnerships of any shape or number, and people navigating them on their own.</p>"),
 qa("Are sessions in person or online?",
    "<p>Therapy is offered by telehealth across Ohio, Arizona and Colorado. Sound healing is currently "
    "offered in person. Breathwork can be done remotely.</p>"),
